# Hospital Database Management – SQL Project

This project is based on a hospital scenario where patient details, doctor appointments, and medical records are stored and managed using SQL. I designed the database from scratch with the aim of practicing real-time data management and exploring SQL queries beyond theoretical knowledge.

## 📌 What this project includes:
- Tables for Patients, Doctors, Appointments, and Diagnosis
- Realistic sample data for testing
- Queries to analyze patient data, doctor activity, common diseases, and more

## 🧠 Why I made this:
Being from a biomedical background, I wanted to work on a database project that relates to healthcare. This helped me apply my SQL skills to a domain I understand well. I also wanted to simulate how data is used in hospitals for better decision-making.

## 🔍 What you’ll find inside:
- hospital_management.sql: All table structures, sample data, and useful queries
- Queries like:
  - Most frequent diseases
  - Patient demographics by department
  - Doctor-wise patient load
  - Appointment tracking

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- SQL (compatible with MySQL / SQLite / PostgreSQL)
- VS Code for editing

## 🚀 What I learned:
- Writing complex queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions
- Structuring relational databases
- Thinking in terms of real-world workflows, not just academic examples
